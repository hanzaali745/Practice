git branch <name-of-new-branch>  --> Creates a branch

git branch -a --> lists all the available branches (when a developers completes the work on the command1 branches, then they can merge the command1 branch to the master branch) 

--> any new changes that are made inside the command1 branch does not be replicated to the master branch automatically and vice versa.
